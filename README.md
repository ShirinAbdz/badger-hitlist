# Introduction
This is a project for members of the 100Devs agency, San Francisco. 

It is an internal tool for freelancers who are interested in moving on to a more regular job. It helps to organize and follow up on contacts for the search.

The software is made to help people follow Leon Noel's advice on the search.

# Stack
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It uses Prisma as an object relational management tool to connect to an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL database. The project started without using typescript and may have that added later. 

It will be hosted in a serverless fashion on Vercel. 

# Using the app
